The files generator.pl, libvirt_c_epilogue.c, libvirt_c_oneoffs.c,
libvirt_c_prologue.c, libvirt.ml, and libvirt.mli come from the
libvirt-ocaml library:

  https://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt-ocaml.git

which is released under a compatible license.  We want to keep them
identical, so changes to these files must be submitted to
libvirt-ocaml first.

Before libguestfs 1.42 is released we hope to have unbundled this
library and will require that libvirt-ocaml is used instead.
